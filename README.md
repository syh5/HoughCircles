# HoughCircles

This is inspired by inbuilt functioanality in OpenCV on Hough Transform. The code was written for a competition where target needed to be detected and a package was supposed to be dropped on the target.

To run the code download and extract the zip. Go to the folder in the terminal and do:

    cmake.
    make

and if there are no errors:

    ./main target.jpg

it should look something like this:
